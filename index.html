                Consumers increasingly rely on IoT products to manage essential aspects of daily life, including home safety, health, recreation, and personal convenience. Design and implementation practices of IoT devices are known to be heterogeneous, with vendor-specific protocols, designs and developments for device access, communication, and security management. This diversity poses significant challenges to both IoT security and consumer usability. In response, the emergence of IoT standards aims to address these issues. Notable examples include the Matter open-source project, a major industry collaboration that provides a unified standard for IoT design and implementation, simplifying development for manufacturers and enhancing device compatibility for consumers. Additionally, the IoT Labeling Program of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeks to establish security standards for manufacturers.
                <br><br>
                Any security and privacy problems in IoT standards and standardized IoT practices can be easily inherited by real IoT products of many manufacturers. This workshop aims to promote research that investigates and evaluates the foundational role of IoT design standards and their implementations (open-source and closed source) for the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of IoT systems. The IoT industry, open-source community and academia are expected to develop and apply practical, rigorous security and privacy measures to ensure that IoT standards and standardization processes are both well-designed and properly implemented.

                    Abstract: IoT devices are increasingly popular and ubiquitous in numerous everyday settings. They sense and actuate the environment using a wide range of analog peripherals. They are often deployed in large numbers and perform critical tasks. It is no surprise that they represent attractive targets for various attacks. Recent history shows that few lessons were learned from well-known attacks and IoT devices are still commonly compromised via both known attacks and zero-day exploits. Alas, the worst is yet to come. This talk will consider several reasons for the current state of affairs in IoT (in)security and motivate research on actively secure and formally assured operation of IoT devices. This direction is both important and timely since common sense dictates that it is better to be prepared for a disaster that never comes than to be unprepared for the one that does.

                        The AI-Cybersecurity Nexus - Opportunities, Challenges, and Solutions
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing cybersecurity, offering enhanced threat detection, proactive prevention, and streamlined response mechanisms. In this keynote, we will explore how AI is reshaping the cybersecurity landscape, especially IoT security, enabling faster incident resolution, more intuitive security tools, and greater overall efficiency. We will share key insights into what works, what doesn’t, and lessons learned from real-world implementations.
                        However, while AI strengthens cybersecurity, it also introduces new vulnerabilities—adversarial AI, automated cyberattacks, and novel threat vectors that traditional defenses struggle to address. We will examine these emerging risks and the evolving tactics of malicious actors who leverage AI against security systems.
                        Finally, this session will present actionable solutions to mitigate AI-driven threats, including fighting AI with AI, platformization, precision AI, adaptive defense strategies, responsible AI deployment, and the integration of AI with human intelligence to create more resilient security frameworks. Join us as we navigate the AI-cybersecurity nexus and chart a course toward a safer digital future.<br/><br/>
